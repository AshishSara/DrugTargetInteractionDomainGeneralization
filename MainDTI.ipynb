    "In this preprocessing workflow for a drug-target interaction (DTI) machine learning model, several critical steps were undertaken to prepare the data for modeling. This process began with the importation of necessary libraries and tools, including those for chemical utilities, data manipulation, plotting, machine learning model construction, and transformers for natural language processing (NLP) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loading: The initial step involved loading three distinct datasets from the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) related to drug-target interactions, specifically focusing on different measures of drug binding affinity: dissociation constant (Kd), half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), and inhibition constant (Ki). Each dataset represents a different aspect of how strongly a drug can bind to its target, which is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of a drug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Transformation: The labels (binding affinities) of these datasets were converted to logarithmic scale. This transformation is typically performed to normalize the distribution of the data, as binding affinity values can span several orders of magnitude, making models more stable and improving learning efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cold-Start Split: A cold-start split was performed on each dataset based on the 'Drug' column. This method of splitting ensures that the model can generalize well to unseen drugs, a common scenario in drug discovery where the goal is often to predict the activity of new compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecule Filtering: A function named filter_molecules was defined to filter out molecules that do not meet specific criteria, such as Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) filters and physicochemical properties like hydrogen bond donors (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), LogP (a measure of lipophilicity), molecular weight (MW), the number of rotatable bonds (Rot), and topological polar surface area (TPSA). This filtering is crucial to remove molecules unlikely to be drug-like or those that might interfere with assays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application of Molecule Filtering: The molecule filtering function was applied to each split (train, validation, test) of each dataset, ensuring that only molecules meeting the defined criteria were included in further analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Alignment: After filtering, a step was added to align the labels (binding affinities) with the filtered data. This alignment is necessary because filtering might change the order or number of samples, and ensuring that each data point's label correctly corresponds is critical for accurate model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization and Statistics: Functions were defined and used to visualize the distribution of the log-transformed labels for each dataset split and to print basic statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and counts of unique compounds and targets. These steps are vital for understanding the data's characteristics, identifying potential issues, and ensuring that the model has a sufficient variety of examples to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing workflow is foundational for building a robust and generalizable machine learning model for predicting drug-target interactions. It ensures that the data is clean, relevant, and prepared in a way that aligns with the challenges of drug discovery and development."

    "This code performs several preprocessing steps on datasets related to drug-target interaction (DTI), specifically focusing on binding affinity data from the BindingDB database, in three different measurement types: Kd, IC50, and Ki. Here's a brief summary of the preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading Datasets: It loads three DTI datasets from the BindingDB database, each representing a different type of binding affinity measurement (Kd, IC50, Ki).\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Transformation: For each dataset, it converts the labels (binding affinity values) into logarithmic scale. This transformation is commonly used to handle the wide range of affinity values and to normalize the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cold-start Split: It splits each dataset into training, validation, and test sets using a \"cold-start\" approach, where the split is based on unique drugs. This method ensures that the drugs in the validation and test sets are not seen during training, simulating a realistic scenario where predictions are made for new, unseen drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecule Filtering: A custom function filter_molecules is defined to filter molecules based on specific chemical property criteria using the MolFilter class. The filters include PAINS (Pan-assay interference compounds) filter and criteria for Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD), Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA), LogP (partition coefficient), Molecular Weight (MW), Rotatable Bonds (Rot), and Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA). This step aims to remove potentially problematic or unfeasible molecules from the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter Application and Label Alignment: The molecule filtering is applied to each split of each dataset. Additionally, a function align_labels is used to ensure that the labels are correctly aligned with the filtered dataset, preserving the match between each molecule and its binding affinity value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: It provides a function to visualize the distribution of the log-scaled labels for each dataset and split, aiding in understanding the data distribution post-preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Statistics Printing: Finally, the code prints basic statistics for each filtered and split dataset, including descriptive statistics of the data and counts of unique compounds and targets. This step helps in assessing the diversity and characteristics of the preprocessed datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this preprocessing pipeline is designed to prepare the DTI data for machine learning models by transforming, filtering, and splitting the data while ensuring that the models will train on clean and representative datasets.\n",

    "In this segment of the preprocessing workflow for a drug-target interaction machine learning model, a validation step is performed to ensure the integrity and alignment of the data after preprocessing, specifically focusing on the KD dataset as an example. This process is crucial for verifying that the dataset is correctly prepared for the model training phase, preventing potential issues that could arise from misaligned data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating Over Dataset Splits: The code iterates over each split of the KD dataset—train, validation, and test splits. This iteration ensures that the validation check is comprehensive, covering all portions of the dataset that will be used in different stages of model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting Samples and Labels: Within each split, the number of samples and the number of labels ('Y') are counted. The count of samples corresponds to the number of drug molecules that have been filtered based on specific criteria, such as drug-likeness and physicochemical properties. The count of labels refers to the number of binding affinity values (in log space) associated with these samples. This step is crucial for ensuring that each sample (drug molecule) has a corresponding label (binding affinity value), which is essential for supervised learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertion for Alignment: An assertion is used to check that the number of samples matches the number of labels for each dataset split. This assertion acts as a safeguard against data misalignment, where a sample might not have a corresponding label or vice versa. If the number of samples does not equal the number of labels, the assertion will fail, and an error message will be printed, specifying the split with the mismatch and the counts of samples and labels. This error message aids in quickly identifying and rectifying issues with the dataset preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Printing Dataset Information: If the assertion passes (indicating that the samples and labels are aligned), information about the dataset split is printed, detailing the number of samples and labels. This output serves not only as a confirmation of data integrity but also provides insight into the size of the dataset, which can be useful for understanding the scope of the training, validation, and testing phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This validation step is a critical component of the data preprocessing workflow, ensuring that the data is correctly prepared and aligned before proceeding to model training. By verifying the alignment between samples and labels, this process helps to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the subsequent machine learning model in predicting drug-target interactions."

    "In this expanded phase of preprocessing for a drug-target interaction machine learning model, after ensuring data integrity and alignment, the workflow progresses to generate embeddings for both drugs and targets. This step is pivotal for transforming the chemical structures and protein sequences into a format that machine learning models can effectively utilize. Embeddings represent high-dimensional vector spaces where similar entities are closer together, facilitating the learning of complex relationships.\n",

    "Generating Drug Embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: The process begins with the initialization of a tokenizer and model specifically designed for chemical structures (SMILES strings), using the pre-trained ChemBERTa-zinc-base-v1 model from the Hugging Face transformers library. This model is adept at understanding and processing chemical language.\n",
    "Embedding Function: A function, get_drug_embeddings, is defined to convert a list of SMILES strings into embeddings. For each SMILES string, it tokenizes the string, passes the tokens through the pre-trained model, and applies mean pooling over the output to get a single embedding vector for each molecule.\n",
    "Application: This function is then applied to the filtered drug lists from the KD, IC50, and Ki datasets across their respective train, validation, and test splits, generating embeddings for each drug.\n",
    "Generating Target (Protein) Embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: Similarly, a tokenizer and model are initialized for protein sequences using the Rostlab/prot_bert pre-trained model. This model is designed to capture the complexity of protein sequences.\n",
    "Embedding Function: The get_target_embeddings function is crafted to process a list of protein sequences. By adding specific tokens that ProtBERT recognizes (such as \"A\" for the start and \"B\" for the end of sequences), it generates embeddings for each sequence, focusing on the embedding of the [CLS] token, which is intended to represent the entire sequence's information.\n",
    "Application: This embedding function is applied to the target sequences from each dataset split, producing embeddings for each target.\n",
    "Validation of Embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the generation of drug and target embeddings, a validation step ensures that the number of embeddings matches the number of labels in each dataset split. This check is crucial for verifying that each drug and target pair has corresponding embeddings and labels, ensuring data consistency and alignment for model training.\n",
    "Assertions are used to verify that the number of drug embeddings, target embeddings, and labels are equal within each split. If any mismatch is detected, it raises an error, prompting a review and correction of the preprocessing steps.\n",
    "Upon successful validation, confirmation messages are printed, indicating the number of drug embeddings, target embeddings, and labels, and confirming their alignment.\n",
    "This detailed preprocessing and validation ensure that the input data for the machine learning model is not only clean and relevant but also transformed into a format that encapsulates the complex chemical and biological information necessary for predicting drug-target interactions accurately."

    "\n",
    "The PCA plot shows a relatively dense cluster in the center with some points spread out more widely. This could indicate that while many of the samples have similar features (hence clustering near the center), there are also quite a few that are different (the points spread out from the center).\n",
    "The lack of distinct, separate clusters in the PCA plot suggests that the variability within the data isn't strongly polarized along the two principal components. This might mean that the data doesn't have clear-cut, separable classes, or that PCA's linear reduction isn't capturing the complexity of the interactions.\n",
    "t-SNE Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-SNE plot shows a more nuanced structure with several small clusters and regions of varying data density. This is typical of t-SNE visualizations, which can reveal local structures and relationships that PCA might miss.\n",
    "Some clustering can be observed, but the groups are not very distinct, with much of the data still forming a continuous, albeit non-uniform, field. This may suggest that while there are some localized patterns, the overall dataset is quite complex with possibly overlapping classes or a smooth gradient of properties.\n",
    "What These Results Tell Us:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity of Data: Both visualizations suggest that the drug-target interaction space is complex, with no simple divisions. This is consistent with the nature of biological data, which often exists along a continuum with nuanced variations rather than discrete classes.\n",
    "Embedding Quality: The embeddings appear to capture a range of information, given the spread in the visualizations, but there might not be simple, easily separable features that can be used for classification or regression. The embeddings may still be very useful for machine learning, but it's likely that sophisticated models (like deep neural networks) will be needed to capture the subtleties in the data.\n",
    "Model Selection: Given the lack of distinct clustering, models that can handle complex patterns and subtle distinctions are likely to perform better. Non-linear models, such as deep learning models that can capture complex relationships, may be required.\n",
    "Further Analysis: It may be helpful to color these plots based on known properties (like whether a drug is active/inactive or the target's class) to see if any of the visible clusters correspond to meaningful biological or chemical distinctions.\n",
    "Remember, PCA and t-SNE are just tools for exploring high-dimensional data and should be used alongside other data analysis and machine learning techniques. These plots do not necessarily determine the predictiveness of the features but can provide insights into the structure of the dataset and inform further analysis.\n",

    "Based on the complexity of the data as revealed by the PCA and t-SNE visualizations, and the fact that we looking to predict continuous values (such as binding affinity) rather than discrete classes, regression models would indeed be appropriate. Here are the types of machine learning models that might be effective for this type of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression Models:\n",
    "Linear Regression Models: As a starting point, we might want to try simple linear regression to establish a baseline, even though it is unlikely to perform well given the complexity suggested by the EDA.\n",
    "Tree-Based Models: More sophisticated tree-based models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) that can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.\n",
    "Support Vector Machines: SVMs with non-linear kernels can be useful for regression tasks (SVR - Support Vector Regression) in complex spaces.\n",
    "Deep Learning Models:\n",
    "Fully Connected Neural Networks: Also known as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), these networks can model complex relationships and interactions.\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): While typically used for image data, CNNs can also be applied to structured, non-image data if there is some local structure in the feature space.\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Useful if the data can be structured as sequences, such as time-series data or if the order of features carries important information.\n",
    "Transformer Models: These can be particularly promising due to their ability to model complex dependencies and patterns in data. Transformers can be used for regression tasks by adapting the output layer to predict continuous values instead of classes.\n",
    "Model Considerations:\n",
    "Data Nature: Given the non-distinct clustering and the possibility of overlapping properties, it is likely that deep learning models, particularly those that can handle complex patterns (like CNNs or Transformers), would be better suited for capturing the subtleties within your data.\n",
    "Transformers: Transformer models are powerful tools for capturing complex relationships in data. They can be particularly effective if we have enough data and computational resources to train them properly. It's important to note that transformers can be used for both classification and regression tasks; for regression, we would typically use the output of the transformer and pass it through a fully connected layer to obtain a single continuous output.\n",
    "Transfer Learning: If we have pre-trained transformer models that are trained on relevant biological or chemical data, fine-tuning them on our specific regression task could lead to good performance.\n",
    "Evaluation and Tuning:\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance and generalizability.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilize grid search or randomized search to find the best hyperparameters for our models.\n",
    "Performance Metrics: Since this is a regression task, we will be looking at metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination).\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "The lack of clear, separable clusters indicates that our dataset likely contains complex, non-linear relationships that are best captured by models capable of handling such complexity. Non-linear models and deep learning approaches, including transformer models adapted for regression, would be suitable choices to explore for predicting drug-target interactions.\n",

    "MSE & RMSE: The Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error are indicators of the average error magnitude in your predictions. The values suggest that, on average, the predictions deviate from the actual values by approximately 2.0 in terms of the binding affinity scale used.\n",
    "MAE: The Mean Absolute Error being around 1.65 indicates that the average absolute error per prediction is somewhat high, suggesting that the model's predictions can be off by this magnitude on average.\n",
    "R-squared: An R-squared value of -1.64 is concerning as it indicates that the model performs worse than a horizontal line representing the mean of the dependent variable. R-squared values should ideally be between 0 and 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a perfect fit. A negative value suggests that the model does not fit the data well at all for the KD dataset.\n",
    "IC50 Dataset:\n",
    "MSE & RMSE: These values are lower than those for the KD dataset, indicating a smaller average error in predictions.\n",
    "MAE: The MAE is also lower, suggesting that predictions are, on average, closer to the actual values.\n",
    "R-squared: The R-squared value is positive, indicating that the model explains some variance in the data, but the value is still quite low (0.178), suggesting that the model's explanatory power is limited.\n",
    "Ki Dataset:\n",
    "Metrics: The metrics for the Ki dataset are similar to those for the IC50 dataset, with slightly higher errors but a similar R-squared value. Like the IC50 dataset, the model has limited explanatory power for the Ki dataset.\n",
    "General Observations:\n",
    "Model Fit: The linear regression model seems to have limited effectiveness in capturing the complex relationships between drug and target features and their interactions for predicting binding affinities. This could be due to the inherent non-linearity and high dimensionality of the problem space.\n",
    "R-squared Concerns: The negative R-squared value for the KD dataset is particularly problematic, indicating that model adjustments or a different modeling approach may be necessary.\n",
    "Potential Improvements: Consider exploring more complex models that can capture non-linear relationships, such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, or neural networks. Feature engineering or selection, normalization or scaling of features, and hyperparameter tuning could also potentially improve model performance.\n",
    "Validation Strategy: Ensure that the training and validation splits are representative of the overall data distribution. Consider using cross-validation to assess model stability across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "Given the complexity of drug-target interaction prediction, experimenting with different model architectures and tuning your approach based on validation feedback is key to finding a model that captures the underlying biological interactions effectively."

    "# Why K-fold Cross Validation Style Evaluation is leading to better results\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics from k-fold cross validation are generally better than without it (hold-out validation) for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Overfitting: K-fold cross-validation trains the model on multiple subsets of the data (folds) and evaluates it on unseen subsets. This helps prevent the model from becoming overly specific to the training data, which can lead to poor performance on new data (overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "More Efficient Use of Data: K-fold CV utilizes all the available data for both training and validation. In contrast, a simple hold-out method might leave a significant portion of the data unused for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "More Reliable Estimates: By performing evaluation on multiple folds, k-fold provides a more statistically robust estimate of the model's generalizability.  A single hold-out validation set might be overly optimistic or pessimistic depending on the random split of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how these points affect the metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE, RMSE, MAE: K-fold validation tends to produce lower values for these error metrics because the model is less likely to be overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "R2, PCC: K-fold validation tends to produce more realistic values for these correlation metrics because the model is evaluated on a broader representation of the data.\n",
    "However, it's important to consider some trade-offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Cost: K-fold cross-validation requires training the model multiple times, making it computationally more expensive than a single hold-out validation.\n",
    "In conclusion, k-fold cross-validation provides a more reliable assessment of a model's performance on unseen data by reducing overfitting, making better use of data, and offering statistically robust estimates. While it may be computationally expensive, the benefits for model generalizability outweigh the cost in most machine learning scenarios."

    "The bar charts display the performance of three different models (LightGBM, Random Forest, and Linear Model) on three datasets (KD, IC50, Ki) according to four metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key observations from the charts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
    "The Linear Model consistently has the highest MSE and RMSE across all datasets, which suggests that it is the least accurate in terms of prediction error.\n",
    "LightGBM and Random Forest have comparable MSE and RMSE values across the IC50 and Ki datasets, with Random Forest performing slightly better in the IC50 dataset and LightGBM performing better in the Ki dataset.\n",
    "For the KD dataset, LightGBM has a lower MSE and RMSE than the Random Forest, indicating better performance.\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "Similar to MSE and RMSE, the Linear Model shows the highest MAE across all datasets, confirming its lower accuracy in predicting drug-target interactions.\n",
    "Random Forest has the lowest MAE in the IC50 dataset, while LightGBM has the lowest MAE in the Ki dataset, making them the more accurate models in their respective datasets.\n",
    "For the KD dataset, LightGBM again shows a slightly better performance with a lower MAE compared to Random Forest.\n",
    "R-squared:\n",
    "R-squared values are generally low across all models and datasets, which could indicate that the models are not capturing all the variability in the data and might benefit from more features or better feature engineering.\n",
    "The Linear Model has negative R-squared values for all datasets, particularly poor for the KD dataset, which suggests the model fits the data worse than a horizontal line at the mean of the target values (essentially, the model has no predictive capability).\n",
    "LightGBM and Random Forest have positive R-squared values for the IC50 and Ki datasets, albeit low, which suggests they are capturing some of the variance in the data.\n",
    "For the KD dataset, both LightGBM and Random Forest also show negative R-squared values, though Random Forest's performance is slightly worse.\n",
    "General Analysis:\n",
    "The drug target interaction prediction models are generally performing better on the IC50 and Ki datasets compared to the KD dataset based on the metrics observed.\n",
    "No single model is best across all metrics and datasets, but the Linear Model consistently underperforms relative to LightGBM and Random Forest.\n",
    "LightGBM seems to offer a good balance between accuracy and complexity, but it might be beneficial to perform further hyperparameter tuning for all models to improve the results, especially given the low R-squared values.\n",
    "Given that drug target interaction prediction is a complex task, it's crucial to consider the biological and chemical significance of the models' predictions, not just the statistical metrics."
